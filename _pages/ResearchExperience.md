## Design of a Rotating Panoramic Camera System for Imaging Large Deformations of Soft Tissues
### University of Pittsburgh, Senior Design Project

As an essential organ, the bladder serves as a container for the urinary. The tissues of the urinary bladder contract and expands in the process, a healthy bladder is able to expand up to eight times its reserve volume at night. However, bladder compliance decreases significantly with age. Bladder compliance is the amount of liquid the bladder can hold as well as the expansion rate of the bladder. The existing strain analysis uses small samples of tissues removed from a full bladder. However, there is no full-view analysis of the mechanism of the whole bladder to account for heterogeneous or anisotropic properties. The development of panoramic camera systems provides biomedical labs with a convenient way to study the realistic deformation of a bladder in action, giving insight into bladder bio-mechanisms, and further informing the development of grafts and other bladder surgery techniques.

This project focuses on a physical system for a panorama camera system that can image all 360 degrees of the bladder.  This system can take photos from two angles, thus allowing 3D strain measurements for only a small portion of the sample upon which the two photos overlapped. Further research on surface strains and pressure in the bladder deformation process contributes to a better understanding of underlying bio-mechanism.
