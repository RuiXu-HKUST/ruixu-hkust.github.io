Hello!

I am Rui Xu, a first-year Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in the Artificial Intelligence Hub, advised by [Sihong XIE](http://ait.hkust-gz.edu.cn/archives/1375). I am funded by Postgraduate Studentship Award.

Current Research Interests
------
My main research focuses on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). I am working on the combination of uncertainty analysis and PINNs to compute partial differential equations with stochastic measurements as inputs.  My interests also include optimization methodologies, such as active learning and self-adaptive weighting, to improve PINNs' efficiency and accuracy. Meanwhile, I am seeking to apply PINNs to solve real-world problems, like traffic state estimation and robotic control.

Education
------
I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and Sichuan University honored on Dean's List.  
I pursued an M.Eng at the University of California, Berkeley, concentrating on Modeling and Simulation for Advanced Manufacturing, advised by [Tarek I. Zohdi](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/tarek-i-zohdi/).
