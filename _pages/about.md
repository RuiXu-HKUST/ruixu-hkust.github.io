Hello!
I am Rui Xu, a first-year Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in the Artificial Intelligence Hub, advised by [Sihong XIE](http://ait.hkust-gz.edu.cn/archives/1375) and funded by Postgraduate Studentship Award.

Current Research Interests
------
My primary research revolves around Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), with a strong focus on Conformal Prediction (CP). I am particularly interested in enhancing the adaptiveness of CP, especially under distribution shifts, to ensure reliable uncertainty estimation in dynamic and evolving data environments.

Additionally, I am exploring the integration of CP with diverse data modalities, including natural language, images, and multi-modal datasets, aiming to expand its applicability across various domains. I am also actively engaged in real-world applications of CP, collaborating with hospitals and industry partners to develop robust CP techniques tailored for multi-center scenarios, ensuring reliability and fairness in practical deployments. 

Education
------
I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and Sichuan University honored on Dean's List.  
I pursued an M.Eng at the University of California, Berkeley, concentrating on Modeling and Simulation for Advanced Manufacturing, advised by [Tarek I. Zohdi](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/tarek-i-zohdi/).
